## SinteringFit

Software for data processing, analysis and construction of the MSC, in sintering experiments.

This software is planned to be used as a free code software for dilatometry analysis.
The user can proccess data, apply corrections, accordingly to:

***Dilatometry analysis of the sintering process of nanostructured gadolinia-doped ceria***

RM Batista, ENS Muccillo

Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry 126 (3), 1007-1013


The Master sintering curve can be constructed accordingly to:

***Master sintering curve: a practical approach to sintering.***

Su H, Johnson DL

Journal of the American Ceramic Society 1996;79:3211–7.


The Arrhenius analysis can be performed accordingly as:

***Estimate of activation energies for boundary
diffusion from rate-controlled sintering of pure alumina, and
alumina doped with zirconia or titania.***

Wang J, Raj R.

Journal of the American Ceramic Society 1990;73:1172–5
